    "When live streaming conferences, audio and video need to be in sync. It means low latency is important. Vorbis has lower latency (5 ms to 66.5 ms) than MP3 (at least 100 ms). However, there are much better codecs for voice recording/playback, such as G.722 (4 ms latency) or AMR (25 ms latency).<br>\n",
